## Introduction
* * Website Link goes here * *

Kaleidoscope is my fifth and last project submision for the Full Stack E-Commerece Diploma by Code Institute.

The project's theme is a photographer's website, where the photographer as the owner of it can show his work, sale his photos and offer online photography courses as well as organised photography tours. Any user has the ability to stay as simple visitor but also to register or login in order to buy any of the photographer's services. The main technologies that the application uses are: 
 - Html
 - Css
 - Bootstrap
 - Javascript
 - Python
 - Django

The website is clean and aims to reach a vast target audience. Its simple design makes the navigation intuitive and easy, all the materials nicely presented to clean background, giving the business a higher chance that the customer will feel comfortable and stay on the website to navigate further.
